How to build a package:

Read the guides or at least install the necessary packages as detailed here:

http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/index.en.html
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete


Set-up your ~/.bachrc so the package scripts known who you are:
e.g. 
export DEBFULLNAME='Paul Broadhead' 
export DEBEMAIL='pjbroad@twinmoons.org.uk'


If you're going to sign the package make sure you have keys set-up:

Now we're ready:

Set the version number
	
	elver="1.9.2"
	packagename="eternallands-sound"

Make a destination directory:

	mkdir ${packagename}-${elver}

Copy packaging files:

	rm -rf ${packagename}-${elver}/debian
	cp -a sound/debian/ ${packagename}-${elver}/
	rm -rf ${packagename}-${elver}/debian/CVS

Append the licence file and clean up:

	wget -O - http://www.eternal-lands.com/page/license.txt | fmt -w 79 >> ${packagename}-${elver}/debian/copyright
	less ${packagename}-${elver}/debian/copyright

Save the source archive:

	tar cfz ${packagename}_${elver}.orig.tar.gz ${packagename}-${elver}

Move into package directory:

	cd ${packagename}-${elver}/

Make any modifications required then update the changelog:

	dch -i

Build the package:

	debuild
	debuild -S -sa
