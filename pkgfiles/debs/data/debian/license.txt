This is the license for Eternal Lands. Before playing the game, you have to agree with the 
stuff written here.
I will try to keep it in English, unlike most of the software out there, who use a veeeeeeery
hard to understand legal language :D

1. Basically, this software can be freely distributed. That is, if you want to put it on your
web site, or on a CD, etc. feel free to do it. However, it would be a good idea to tell me
(chaos_rift at yahoo.com) if you do that, so I can send you a notification when it will be updated.

2. If you can make money using this software, by letting others play it 
(say, you own an Internet Cafe), then good for you, we don't require you to pay us, even tho
it would be nice if you would :)

3. You are NOT allowed to take our art (2d/3d files), and use it for your own devious purpose,
either commercial or not. The only exception is if you want to make some sort of fan website,
in which case it is OK to use some of our art on that site. Of course, taking a screenshot and
using it for whatever you need is perfectly OK.
Just don't use our art for your own game/software. If you really want to do that, then send me
an e-mail, with information on where/how/what/why you want to use, and, most likely, we can come
to a deal.

4. If you want to [re]distribute this game, you are NOT allowed to modify anything. You can, however,
distribute some txt/doc/etc file, with information about you, etc.

5. If something goes bad with this game (ie. it doesn't work on your computer, it crashes your
computer, it kills your GF/BF/cat/familly/etc. it is not our fault, and you agree NOT to sue us.)
If you kill someone because you played this game, it is also not our fault, but your 
parents fault! :D No, really, I am tired of seeing on TV how this or that kid killed someone,
and s/he justified it like: "I played this or that game, and I thought it would be k3w1 to do it too,
in real life".
Anyway, this software contains no code that is harmful to your computer. That is, it's not like
we put some HDD formatting code, or something. Normally, nothing bad should happen by simply 
running this software.

6. This license might change in the future, and if/when it will change, you have to agree with
the new license. 


7. This software, and the web page doesn't store the login information in an encrypted way.
Also, the login information should be regarded as non secure. That is, do NOT use any already
existing password, like, say, your e-mail, ICQ, bank account, etc. password. If we get hacked,
and/or if someone intercepts your password, we have no fault. I mean, ok, we do have a morale
fault, but no legal fault, so you can't sue us.
I stress again on this: DO NOT USE ANY ALREADY EXISTING PASSWORD WHEN YOU REGISTER TO THIS
GAME, OR THE WEBPAGE.

8. Scripting/macroing (the action of automating processes such as harvesting) with little or no human 
intervention is considered cheating, and if you do it, and get caught, you might have your account deleted.

9. If something happenes with your account (some accident, haxx0r, punishment, etc.) we have no obligation to 
restore it. If such thing does happen, however, we will try our best to fix the problem, but we are only humans, 
so you agree NOT to sue us, or demand anything from us.

10. You have to agree with the ingame rules.

11. You will also have to agree with the rules found in our forum, under the Rules section. Failure to do so may result in getting banned.

12. If you start/play the game, it means you agreed with all the terms here.
